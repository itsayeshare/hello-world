# hello-world
just starting out.
i'm really afriad of trying new things and i am taking a lot of time to admit this. coding scares me and i just wanted to try this course R language. I really hope I am able to finish this without getting anxious or depressed or not motivated to do this. im scared of trying to do this course. its the only reason i am putting it off for so long. im scared, i dont know how to stop being scared and how do i overcome this feeling, its been four months now. i dont want to be a screw up and i dont want to be a dissapointment to my family. its like the nervousness before entering a stage.
